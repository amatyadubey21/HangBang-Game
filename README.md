# HangBang-Game
HangBang is a classical paper and pencil game for two or more players which everyone played during its childhood. The player has limited number of errors he can make when suggesting a letter. In this project, we are going to create a HangBang Game in Java with the computer choosing a word and the user who must find this word.
